06/13/2022: add some quantum gates
 - controlled U1 gate
 - controlled U2 gate
 - controlled U3 gate
 - controlled CSWAP gate

06/14/2022: add various measurement functions
 - M(qubit) : The qubit collapses according to the quantum probability.
 - MF(qubit, state) : This forces the qubit to collapse to a certain state.
 - MNOP(qubit) : This predict probabilistic measure state without collpasing the qubit.

06/15/2022: Update Makefiles
 - Support the default library path for boost library (yum or apt installation)
